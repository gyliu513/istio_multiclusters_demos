# Istio Multi-Clusters Demos
A bunch of demos for installing Istio on a Multi-Clusters environment.

# Credits
The demos in this repository are based on work done by @rshriram [https://github.com/rshriram/istio_federation_demo] and @ZackButcher [https://github.com/ZackButcher/hybrid-demo] of using the Istio Ingress and Egress gateways to integrate two clusters.
